Wizards' recently published [Unearthed Arcana](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/class-feature-variants) focused on character option variants that "replace or enhance a class’s normal features, giving you new ways to enjoy your character’s class." Well, who wouldn't want more ways to enjoy your character? Let's dig in.

## TL;DR
I'm comfortable with all the options presented, so you can:

* adopt feature enhancements for features you chose or benefit from immediately; and
* choose replacement features once they become available to you through leveling.

Enticing though it may be, you cannot choose replacement features at levels that have already passed.

## Rundown

### All classes

#### Proficiency Versatility
When you get an Ability Score Improvement, you can also replace one of your skill proficiencies another offered by your class at 1st level. This will help you make more use of skills as your character grows and encounters new and different challenges.

**You may retroactively apply this to your last ASI.** At our next session, you may replace one skill proficiency with another.

### Barbarian
A few early level enhancements, perfect for a character who has decided to dip into the class!

* **Survival Instincts** (p. 1). Unavailable to Angua, since she has taken Danger Sense.
* **Instinctive Pounce** (p. 1). Very interesting option for quickly engaging foes and protecting allies.

### Druid
Really big enhancements for druids in this material:

* **Cantrip Versatility** (p. 4). That cantrip you took and regret? Go ahead and swap it out for another. **You can do this once at our next session.**
* **Druid Spells** (p. 4). Your spell list just got bigger - rad.
* **Wild Companion** (p. 5). Expend a use of Wild Shape to summon a fey familiar for several hours! I can't wait to see how this gets used.

### Fighter
The extra variants mostly apply to Battlemasters.

* **Fighting Style Options** (p. 5). This is an available option (see Fighting Styles, below). **You can do this once at our next session.**
* **Maneuver Versatility** (p. 5). Not applicable to Angua.
* **Maneuver Options** (p. 5). Not applicable to Angua.

### Paladin
A few bumps to the paladin class here.

* **Fighting Style Options** (p. 6). This is an available option (see Fighting Styles, below). **You can do this once at our next session.**
* **Paladin Spells** (p. 6). Your spell list just got bigger - rad.
* **Channel Divinity: Harness the Power** (p. 6). Available immediately for those times when you desperately need a clutch spell slot.

### Wizard
Small and yet useful bumps for wizards.

* **Cantrip Versatility** (p. 4). That cantrip you took and regret? Go ahead and swap it out for another. **You can do this once at our next session.**
* **Wizard Spells** (p. 6). Your spell list just got a little bigger - cool.

### Fighting Styles
Fighters, paladins and rangers have the Fighting Style feature, so you benefit from the following enhancements:

* **Martial Versatility** (p. 12). If your class has the Fighting Style feature and you gain a level in that class, you can replace a fighting style you know with another available to your class.
* **Style Options** (pp. 12-13). Some more fighting style options, a few of which I think are quite interesting!

I deliberately left out other classes, but if you decide to multiclass into something new you will also be able to use these UA rules.
