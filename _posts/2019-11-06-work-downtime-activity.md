When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents an attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

**Resources.** Performing a job requires one day of effort and generally doesn’t require you to supply material resources.

**Preparation.** Unless you’re specifically looking for trouble, no special preparations are necessary to find straightforward temporary work.

**Resolution.** To determine how much money you earn, make an ability check chosen by the DM based on the work you did. If the job requires a set of tools and you’re proficient in them, you’ll be able to add your proficiency bonus to the skill check.

##### Wages

| Check total | Earnings |
|:---:|:---|
| 9 or lower | Poor lifestyle for the day |
| 10-14 | Modest lifestyle for the day |
| 15-20 | Comfortable lifestyle for the day |
| 21+ | Comfortable lifestyle for the day + 5 gp |

**Complications.** Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Doing a particularly poor job could make a rival out of someone you worked for or with or could result in your reputation being sullied. On the other hand, doing a stellar job could create new you a new contact or potential ally.

> You must have set up your Phandalin Phried to operate in Waterdeep before you can work for yourselves.
