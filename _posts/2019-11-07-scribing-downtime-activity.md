With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a *spell scroll*.

**Resources.** Scribing a *spell scroll* takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, which represents the arcane materials and mental effort needed to complete the scribing work. The total time and gold needed is shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the characterâ€™s known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

##### Spell Scroll Costs (Spell Level, Time, Cost)
| Spell Level | Time | Cost |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| Cantrip | 1 day | 5 gp |
| 1st | 3 days | 30 gp |
| 2nd | 4 days | 60 gp |
| 3rd | 5 days | 100 gp |
| 4th | 10 days | 160 gp |
| 5th | 15 days | 320 gp |
| 6th | 20 days | 640 gp |
| 7th | 35 days | 1280 gp |
| 8th | 60 days | 2560 gp |
| 9th | 90 days | 5120 gp |

**Preparation.** No preparations beyond the resources required are needed to scribe a scroll.

**Resolution.** After spending the amount of time, gold, and effort (probably locked away in solitude), you create the *spell scroll*.

**Complications.** Crafting a *spell scroll* is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. Depending on the level of the spell that you are scribing, the nature of the spell itself, or location that you are performing your work, you may attract unwanted attention.
