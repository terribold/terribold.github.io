Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

**Preparation.** The quality and reputation of your teacher can impact your training. You may optionally prepare for training by engaging in research or carousing to locate a trustworthy, reliable and competent instructor.

**Resources.** Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least five tendays, but this time is reduced by a number of days equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs average 5 gp per day but might be more or less depending on the availability of instructors and the nature of the language or tool proficiency you are training in.

**Resolution.** For each day that you complete in training, you earn progress towards your proficiency. After training for at least the minimum time required, you gain proficiency in the skill.

**Complications.** Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Having a shady or low-quality teacher could result in you losing your investment, impact your reputation, or draw you into a conflict.
