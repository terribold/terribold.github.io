Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also the default if you donâ€™t want to make use of the downtime system. 

**Resources.** You need to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.

**Preparation.** Other than finding a good place to relax in, no special preparations are necessary.

**Resolution.** While relaxing, you gain advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, if you relax for a ten-day, you can end one effect that keeps you from regaining hit points, or you can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.

**Complications.** Relaxation rarely comes with complications, aside from complications you make for yourself!
